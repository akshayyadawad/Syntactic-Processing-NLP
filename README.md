# Syntactic-Processing

## ‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions.

The dataset is about the labels corresponding to the diseases and the treatment. There are three labels that have been used in this dataset: O, D, and T, which are corresponding to 'Other,' 'Disease,' and 'Treatment,' respectively.

There are eight major tasks that need to be performed to complete. They are as follows:

- Data preprocessing
- Concept identification
- Defining the features for CRF
- Getting the features words and sentences
- Defining input and target variables
- Building the model
- Evaluating the model
- Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER

Dataset Explanation
We have four data files to proceed with this activity, they are:

- Train Sentence Dataset
- Train Label Dataset
- Test Sentence Dataset
- Test Label Dataset

Sentence file contains all interactions between patients and doctors, and Label file contains all entity tags for particular words arranged as per sentence. We need to do a few preprocessing steps while accessing the dataset, which we will explore further in subsequent steps.
